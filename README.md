# benchmark_cpp
Benchmark for C++ (sorting a list, similar to project 'benchmark_java' for Java) - Platform: CLion/MinGW-w64 
                                            
Attempt to make a rough comparison to the very similar repository 'benchmark_java' for Java, 
allowing for a rough performance comparison between C++ and Java.
